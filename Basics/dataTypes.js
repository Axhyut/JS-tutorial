//object => In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or symbols) and values can be any data type, including other objects. 
//objects are used to store and organize data and can represent real-world entities.
//object is a complex data type used to store collections of data and more complex entities. 
//objects in JavaScript are one of the core components, allowing the creation of structured data and enabling object-oriented programming.

console.log(typeof "Achyut");  //tells the data type of a value 
console.log(typeof age);       //tells the data type of a variable

//NOTE: the data type of null is object
console.log(typeof null);
