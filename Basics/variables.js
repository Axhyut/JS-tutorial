const accountId = 144553;
let accountEmail = "akd@gmail.com";
var accountPassword = "123456";

let accountState;

//let, const, var: assigns the value inside the memory

console.table([accountId, accountEmail, accountPassword, accountCity])

//for declaring constants and varibles mainly const and let is used
//prefer not to use var becasue of the issue in block scope and  functional scope

console.log(accountState);

//we can declare a variable even without assigning any value
//JS considers this as undefined variable
